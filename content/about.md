We are the competitive cybersecurity team based in Parma, in Italy.

We are a collective of students, and security enthusiasts focused on the practical application of information security. Our group was born from the competitive spirit of CTF (Capture The Flag) events.

### What We Do

**Competition**
We actively participate in national and international hacking competitions. Our team members have consistently qualified for the finals of major Italian initiatives, including CyberChallenge.IT and the Italian Cybersecurity Olympics (OliCyber). We specialize in:
* Web Security
* Binary Exploitation & Reverse Engineering
* Cryptography

**Education & Training**
We believe the best way to learn security is to break it. We run internal training programs to bridge the gap between theoretical computer science and real-world vulnerability research. By collaborating with the University of Parma (UniPR), we mentor the next generation of ethical hackers, preparing them for the technical demands of the industry.

**CodeVinci CTF**
We don't just play; we build. We organize the *<a href="https://challs.codevinci.it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeVinci CTF</a>*, an annual Jeopardy-style competition designed to introduce beginners to cybersecurity while challenging experienced players. Our goal is to create a proving ground for local and remote talent.

### Our Philosophy

We value hands-on experience over certifications and problem-solving over tools. Whether we are debugging a segfault during a late-night CTF or teaching students how to secure a Linux server, our focus remains the same: understand how it works, find the flaw, and fix it.

### Connect

We are based at ITIS Leonardo da Vinci, Via Toscana 10, Parma.
